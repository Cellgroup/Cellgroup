abstract: >-
  The rapid advancement of cell therapy and regenerative medicine has intensified
  the need for precise cellular analysis, with fluorescent microscopy serving as a
  primary investigative tool. Cellgroup is a computational library that addresses
  challenges through an integrated approach to cell segmentation and cluster analysis
  in well-plate images. The library combines state-of-the-art deep learning-based
  denoising with dedicated analytical modules for intensity measurement, morphological
  characterization, correlation mapping, and temporal tracking.
